Welcome to my 2nd updated version of my personal portfolio!
I have added more SCSS with newly added projects, resume & some skills.
Github, LinkedIn & Resume have been updated as well.
All contact information is displayed on the page if you must reach me.
Unforunately, previous commits were lost after merging the files. The previous count was 23.
